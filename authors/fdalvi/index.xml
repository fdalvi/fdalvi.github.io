      <title>Introducing GroupMe Archiver</title>

      <description>I was recently looking into various ways of archiving old chats into something more future proof, but it seems like these tools are very limited. They either don&amp;rsquo;t exist, or only work for specific scenarios like one-on-one chats without attachments.
Today, the situation gets a bit better for one platform, GroupMe. GroupMe is a platform focused on group messaging, and features nice subtle features like likes per message, attachments and so on.</description>

      <description>Hassan Sajjad and I just had a great time delivering a 5-day crash course at the Universität Duisburg-Essen. It was delivered roughly over 18 hours - with quite a lot of practical exercises! Check out the course materials.
Duisburg was a nice and calm place, with a döner restaurant ready to greet you almost around every corner. The Königstraße was super-lively with a lot of pop-up shops and restaurants, and was quite a fun walk in the afternoon.</description>

      <title>One-Hot layer in Keras&#39;s Sequential API</title>

      <description>It is quite common to use a One-Hot representation for categorical data in machine learning, for example textual instances in Natural Language Processing tasks. In Keras, the Embedding layer automatically takes inputs with the category indices (such as [5, 3, 1, 5]) and converts them into dense vectors of some length (e.g. 5 → [0.2 1.7 3.2 -7.6 ...]). What actually happens internally is that 5 gets converted to a one-hot vector (like [0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 .</description>

      <description>One of our projects in the Arabic Language Team at the Qatar Computing Research Institute is the Speech Translation Project - a real-time low-latency system where a speaker&amp;rsquo;s voice is transcribed and translated (both in Arabic or English). Check out the project here.
This project was recently awarded the Best Innovation Award at the annual Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference! It was been a long effort to take our state-of-the-art research in Speech Recognition and Machine Translation and bring it all together in one system.</description>

      <title>Network throttling in Puppeteer</title>
      <link>https://fdalvi.github.io/blog/2018-02-05-puppeteer-network-throttle/</link>

      <description>Puppeteer is an awesome way to run Chrome (or Chromium) in headless mode, i.e. load and interact with web pages without ever visually seeing them.
 Why would this be useful?
A headless browser is a great way to automate testing, even on remote server machines!
 Puppeteer provides a nice interface through Node to script any interactions you can have with a page, like entering input in a textbox, clicking a button and so on.</description>
