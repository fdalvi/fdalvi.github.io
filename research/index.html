			With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the political and the medical aspects of disinformation merged as the problem got elevated to a whole new level to become the first global infodemic. Fighting this infodemic has been declared one of the most important focus areas of the World Health Organization, with dangers ranging from promoting fake cures, rumors, and conspiracy theories to spreading xenophobia and panic.

		<div class="research-abstract">	
			Transfer learning from pre-trained neural language models towards downstream tasks has been a predominant theme in NLP recently. Several researchers have shown that deep NLP models learn non-trivial amount of linguistic knowledge, captured at different layers of the model. We investigate how fine-tuning towards downstream NLP tasks impacts the learned linguistic knowledge. We carry out a study across popular pre-trained models BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet using layer and neuron-level diagnostic classifiers. We found that for some GLUE tasks, the network relies on the core linguistic information and preserve it deeper in the network, while for others it forgets. Linguistic information is distributed in the pre-trained language models but becomes localized to the lower layers post-fine-tuning, reserving higher layers for the task specific knowledge. The pattern varies across architectures, with BERT retaining linguistic information relatively deeper in the network compared to RoBERTa and XLNet, where it is predominantly delegated to the lower layers.

			With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, people turned to social media to read and to share timely information including statistics, warnings, advice, and inspirational stories. Unfortunately, alongside all this useful information, there was also a new blending of medical and political misinformation and disinformation, which gave rise to the first global infodemic. While fighting this infodemic is typically thought of in terms of factuality, the problem is much broader as malicious content includes not only fake news, rumors, and conspiracy theories, but also promotion of fake cures, panic, racism, xenophobia, and mistrust in the authorities, among others. This is a complex problem that needs a holistic approach combining the perspectives of journalists, fact-checkers, policymakers, government entities, social media platforms, and society as a whole. With this in mind, we define an annotation schema and detailed annotation instructions that reflect these perspectives.

			Low-resource machine translation suffers from the scarcity of training data and the unavailability of standard evaluation sets. While a number of research efforts target the former, the unavailability of evaluation benchmarks remain a major hindrance in tracking the progress in low-resource machine translation. In this paper, we introduce AraBench, an evaluation suite for dialectal Arabic to English machine translation. Compared to Modern Standard Arabic, Arabic dialects are challenging due to their spoken nature, non-standard orthography, and a large variation in dialectness. To this end, we pool together already available Dialectal Arabic-English resources and additionally build novel test sets. AraBench offers 4 coarse, 15 fine-grained and 25 city-level dialect categories, belonging to diverse genres, such as media, chat, religion and travel with varying level of dialectness. We report strong baselines using several training settings: fine-tuning, back-translation and data augmentation. The evaluation suite opens a wide range of research frontiers to push efforts in low-resource machine translation, particularly Arabic dialect translation. The evaluation suite and the dialectal system are publicly available for research purposes.

			While a lot of analysis has been carried to demonstrate linguistic knowledge captured by the representations learned within deep NLP models, very little attention has been paid towards individual neurons. We carry out a neuron-level analysis using core linguistic tasks of predicting morphology, syntax and semantics, on pre-trained language models, with questions like: i) do individual neurons in pretrained models capture linguistic information? ii) which parts of the network learn more about certain linguistic phenomena? iii) how distributed or focused is the information? and iv) how do various architectures differ in learning these properties? We found small subsets of neurons to predict linguistic tasks, with lower level tasks (such as morphology) localized in fewer neurons, compared to higher level task of predicting syntax. Our study reveals interesting cross architectural comparisons. For example, we found neurons in XLNet to be more localized and disjoint when predicting properties compared to BERT and others, where they are more distributed and coupled.

    abstract = &#34;While a lot of analysis has been carried to demonstrate linguistic knowledge captured by the representations learned within deep NLP models, very little attention has been paid towards individual neurons.We carry outa neuron-level analysis using core linguistic tasks of predicting morphology, syntax and semantics, on pre-trained language models, with questions like: i) do individual neurons in pre-trained models capture linguistic information? ii) which parts of the network learn more about certain linguistic phenomena? iii) how distributed or focused is the information? and iv) how do various architectures differ in learning these properties? We found small subsets of neurons to predict linguistic tasks, with lower level tasks (such as morphology) localized in fewer neurons, compared to higher level task of predicting syntax. Our study also reveals interesting cross architectural comparisons. For example, we found neurons in XLNet to be more localized and disjoint when predicting properties compared to BERT and others, where they are more distributed and coupled.&#34;,

			Despite the recent success of deep neural networks in natural language processing and other spheres of artificial intelligence, their interpretability remains a challenge. We analyze the representations learned by neural machine translation (NMT) models at various levels of granularity and evaluate their quality through relevant extrinsic properties. In particular, we seek answers to the following questions: (i) How accurately is word structure captured within the learned representations, which is an important aspect in translating morphologically rich languages? (ii) Do the representations capture long-range dependencies, and effectively handle syntactically divergent languages? (iii) Do the representations capture lexical semantics? We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: (i) Which layers in the architecture capture each of these linguistic phenomena; (ii) How does the choice of translation unit (word, character, or subword unit) impact the linguistic properties captured by the underlying representations? (iii) Do the encoder and decoder learn differently and independently? (iv) Do the representations learned by multilingual NMT models capture the same amount of linguistic information as their bilingual counterparts? Our data-driven, quantitative evaluation illuminates important aspects in NMT models and their ability to capture various linguistic phenomena. We show that deep NMT models trained in an end-to-end fashion, without being provided any direct supervision during the training process, learn a non-trivial amount of linguistic information. Notable findings include the following observations: (i) Word morphology and part-of-speech information are captured at the lower layers of the model; (ii) In contrast, lexical semantics or non-local syntactic and semantic dependencies are better represented at the higher layers of the model; (iii) Representations learned using characters are more informed about word-morphology compared to those learned using subword units; and (iv) Representations learned by multilingual models are richer compared to bilingual models.

		<div class="research-abstract">	
			Verification of online rumours is becoming an increasingly important task with the prevalence of event discussions on social media platforms. This paper proposes an inner-attention-based neural network model that uses frequent, recurring terms from past rumours to classify a newly emerging rumour as true, false or unverified. Unlike other methods proposed in related work, our model uses the source rumour alone without any additional information, such as user replies to the rumour or additional feature engineering. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (RumourEval2017) by 3% accuracy and 6% F-1 leading to 60.7% accuracy and 61.6% F-1. We also compare our attention-based method to two similar models which however do not make use of recurrent terms. The attention-based method guided by frequent recurring terms outperforms this baseline on the same dataset, indicating that the recurring terms injected by the attention mechanism have high positive impact on distinguishing between true and false rumours. Furthermore, we perform out-of-domain evaluations and show that our model is indeed highly competitive compared to the baselines on a newly released RumourEval2019 dataset and also achieves the best performance on classifying fake and legitimate news headlines.

			Neural machine translation (NMT) models learn representations containing substantial linguistic information. However, it is not clear if such information is fully distributed or if some of it can be attributed to individual neurons. We develop unsupervised methods for discovering important neurons in NMT models. Our methods rely on the intuition that different models learn similar properties, and do not require any costly external supervision. We show experimentally that translation quality depends on the discovered neurons, and find that many of them capture common linguistic phenomena. Finally, we show how to control NMT translations in predictable ways, by modifying activations of individual neurons.

			Despite the remarkable evolution of deep neural networks in natural language processing (NLP), their interpretability remains a challenge. Previous work largely focused on what these models learn at the representation level. We break this analysis down further and study individual dimensions (neurons) in the vector representation learned by end-to-end neural models in NLP tasks. We propose two methods: Linguistic Correlation Analysis, based on a supervised method to extract the most relevant neurons with respect to an extrinsic task, and Cross-model Correlation Analysis, an unsupervised method to extract salient neurons w.r.t. the model itself. We evaluate the effectiveness of our techniques by ablating the identified neurons and reevaluating the network’s performance for two tasks: neural machine translation (NMT) and neural language modeling (NLM). We further present a comprehensive analysis of neurons with the aim to address the following questions: i) how localized or distributed are different linguistic properties in the models? ii) are certain neurons exclusive to some properties and not others? iii) is the information more or less distributed in NMT vs. NLM? and iv) how important are the neurons identified through the linguistic correlation method to the overall task? Our code is publicly available as part of the NeuroX toolkit (Dalvi et al. 2019a). This paper is a non-archived version of the paper published at AAAI (Dalvi et al. 2019b).

  abstractNote={Despite the remarkable evolution of deep neural networks in natural language processing (NLP), their interpretability remains a challenge. Previous work largely focused on what these models learn at the representation level. We break this analysis down further and study individual dimensions (neurons) in the vector representation learned by end-to-end neural models in NLP tasks. We propose two methods: &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Linguistic Correlation Analysis&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, based on a supervised method to extract the most relevant neurons with respect to an extrinsic task, and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Cross-model Correlation Analysis&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, an unsupervised method to extract salient neurons w.r.t. the model itself. We evaluate the effectiveness of our techniques by ablating the identified neurons and reevaluating the network’s performance for two tasks: neural machine translation (NMT) and neural language modeling (NLM). We further present a comprehensive analysis of neurons with the aim to address the following questions: i) how localized or distributed are different linguistic properties in the models? ii) are certain neurons exclusive to some properties and not others? iii) is the information more or less distributed in NMT vs. NLM? and iv) how important are the neurons identified through the linguistic correlation method to the overall task? Our code is publicly available as part of the NeuroX toolkit (Dalvi et al. 2019a). This paper is a non-archived version of the paper published at AAAI (Dalvi et al. 2019b).}

		<div class="research-abstract">	
			Children and elderly separating from their family members is a common phenomenon, especially in crowded environments. In order to avoid this problem, places like Disney World and pilgrimage officials have developed systems like wearable tags to determine groups or families. These tags require information about families to be entered manually, either by the users or the facility organizers. The information, if correct, can then be used to help identify and locate a lost person&#39;s group. Manually entering information is inefficient, and usually leads to either long waiting times during entry, or partial information entry within the tags. In this paper, we propose a system that uses proximity sensing to determine groups and families without any input or interaction with the user. In our system, each user is given a wearable device that keeps track of it&#39;s neighbors using bluetooth transmissions. The system then uses this proximity data to predict cliques that represent family members.

			Qlusty generates videos describing the coverage of the same event by different news outlets automatically. Throughout four modules it identifies events, de-duplicates notes, ranks according to coverage, and queries for images to generate an overview video. In this manuscript we present our preliminary models, including quantitative evaluations of the former two and a qualitative analysis of the latter two. The results show the potential for achieving our main aim: contributing in breaking the information bubble, so common in the current news landscape.

			In this paper, we explore alternative ways to train a neural machine translation system in a multi-domain scenario. We investigate data concatenation (with fine tuning), model stacking (multi-level fine tuning), data selection and weighted ensemble. Our findings show that the best translation quality can be achieved by building an initial system on a concatenation of available out-of-domain data and then fine-tuning it on in-domain data. Model stacking works best when training begins with the furthest out-of-domain data and the model is incrementally fine-tuned with the next furthest domain and so on. Data selection did not give the best results, but can be considered as a decent compromise between training time and translation quality. A weighted ensemble of different individual models performed better than data selection. It is beneficial in a scenario when there is no time for fine-tuning.

			Bilingual sequence models improve phrase-based translation and reordering by overcoming phrasal independence assumption and handling long range reordering. However, due to data sparsity, these models often fall back to very small context sizes. This problem has been previously addressed by learning sequences over generalized representations such as POS tags or word clusters. In this paper, we explore an alternative based on neural network models. More concretely we train neuralized versions of lexicalized reordering and the operation sequence models using feed-forward neural network. Our results show improvements of up to 0.6 and 0.5 BLEU points on top of the baseline German→English and English→German systems. We also observed improvements compared to the systems that used POS tags and word clusters to train these models. Because we modify the bilingual corpus to integrate reordering operations, this allows us to also train a sequence-to-sequence neural MT model having explicit reordering triggers. Our motivation was to directly enable reordering information in the encoder-decoder framework, which otherwise relies solely on the attention model to handle long range reordering. We tried both coarser and fine-grained reordering operations. However, these experiments did not yield any improvements over the baseline Neural MT systems.

In this paper we i) analyze how much morphology an NMT decoder learns, and ii) investigate whether injecting target morphology into the decoder helps it produce better translations. To this end we present three methods: i) joint generation, ii) joint-data learning, and iii) multi-task learning.

			While neural machine translation (NMT) models provide improved translation quality in an elegant framework, it is less clear what they learn about language. Recent work has started evaluating the quality of vector representations learned by NMT models on morphological and syntactic tasks. In this paper, we investigate the representations learned at different layers of NMT encoders. We train NMT systems on parallel data and use the models to extract features for training a classifier on two tasks: part-of-speech and semantic tagging. We then measure the performance of the classifier as a proxy to the quality of the original NMT model for the given task. Our quantitative analysis yields interesting insights regarding representation learning in NMT models. For instance, we find that higher layers are better at learning semantics while lower layers tend to be better for part-of-speech tagging. We also observe little effect of the target language on source-side representations, especially in higher quality models.

			The paper describes the QCRI submissions to the shared task of automatic Arabic dialect classification into 5 Arabic variants, namely Egyptian, Gulf, Levantine, North-African (Maghrebi), and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). The relatively small training set is automatically generated from an ASR system. To avoid over-fitting on such small data, we selected and designed features that capture the morphological essence of the different dialects. We submitted four runs to the Arabic sub-task. For all runs, we used a combined feature vector of character bigrams, trigrams, 4-grams, and 5-grams. We tried several machine-learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regres- sion, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with linear and string kernels. Our submitted runs used SVM with a linear kernel. In the closed submission, we got the best accuracy of 0.5136 and the third best weighted F1 score, with a difference of less than 0.002 from the best system.

			This paper describes QCRI’s machine translation systems for the IWSLT 2016 evaluation campaign. We participated in the Arabic→English and English→Arabic tracks. We built both Phrase-based and Neural machine translation models, in an effort to probe whether the newly emerged NMT framework surpasses the traditional phrase-based systems in Arabic-English language pairs. We trained a very strong phrase-based system including, a big language model, the Operation Sequence Model, Neural Network Joint Model and Class-based models along with different domain adaptation techniques such as MML filtering, mixture modeling and using fine tuning over NNJM model. However, a Neural MT system, trained by stacking data from different genres through fine-tuning, and applying ensemble over 8 models, beat our very strong phrase-based system by a significant 2 BLEU points margin in Arabic→English direction. We did not obtain similar gains in the other direction but were still able to outperform the phrase-based system. We also applied system combination on phrase-based and NMT outputs.

		<div class="research-abstract">	
			Ensuring that virtual reality experiences are immersive is key to ensuring the success of VR and even VR. However, despite impressive commercial advancements from the Oculus Rift to the HTC Vive, a number of inherent limitations remain when comparing virtual experiences to real experiences: field of view, limb (mainly hand) tracking, position tracking in the world, haptic feedback, and more. In this study we seek to test a number of creative workarounds to create a fully immersive experience with current technological limitations. We found that overall, immersive experiences could be created, but because of the limitations of the technology, limitations had to be imposed on the virtual world such as how the content had to be presented (interactively and not passively), how objects were destroyed, and more.

		<div class="research-abstract">	
			Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for image classification and object detection, but they can also be used to generate images. For our project, we use CNNs to create a face generation system. Given a set of desired facial characteristics, we produce a well-formed face that matches these attributes. Potential facial char- acteristics fall within the general categories of raw at- tributes (e.g., big nose, brown hair, etc.), ethnicity (e.g., white, black, Indian), and accessories (e.g. sunglasses, hat, etc.). In our face generation system, we fine-tune a convolutional network pre-trained on faces to create a binary classification system for the potential facial charac- teristics. We then employ a novel technique that models feature activations as a custom Gaussian Mixture Model in order to identify relevant features for feature inversion. Our face generation system has many potential uses, in- cluding identifying suspects in law enforcement settings.

		<div class="research-abstract">	
			In the US alone, there are approximately 900,000 hearing impaired people whose primary mode of conversation is sign language. For these people, communication with non-signers is a daily struggle, and they are often disadvantaged when it comes to finding a job, accessing health care, etc. There are a few emerging technologies aimed at overcoming these communication barriers, but most existing solutions rely on cameras to translate sign language into vocal language. While these solutions are promising, they require the hearing impaired person to carry the technology with him/her or for a proper environment to be set up for translation. One alternative is to move the technology onto the person’s body. Devices like the Myo armband available in the market today enable us to collect data about the position of the user’s hands and fingers over time. Since each sign is roughly a combination of gestures across time, we can use these technologies for sign language translation. For our project, we utilize a dataset collected by a group at the University of South Wales, which contains parameters, such as hand position, hand rotation, and finger bend, for 95 unique signs. For each input stream representing a sign, we predict which sign class this stream falls into. We begin by implementing baseline SVM and logistic regression models, which perform reasonably well on high-quality data. Lower quality data requires a more sophisticated approach, so we explore different methods in temporal classification, including long short-term memory architectures and sequential pattern mining methods.

			People often capture several photos of the same scene to produce the best image. Manually choosing the best image out of the candidates is a time consuming process. We propose an algorithm to automatically detect the optimal image out of a set of candidate images. This eliminates the need for people to spend time evaluating the quality of their images, and allows them to focus on enjoying the memories they have experienced.

		<div class="research-abstract">	
			We aim to produce a representation of review threads that is concise, interpretable, and preserves much of the meaning of the full text. Further, the representa- tion should be useful for various applications such as summarization, topic modeling, and star-rating pre- diction. This task can be modelled as a feature se- lection problem which consists of two stages: gen- erating feature proposals and filtering/ranking these features. The first stage automatically produces a large set of human-interpretable candidate features, while the second stage reduces that set to achieve a more concise representation.

		<div class="research-abstract">	
			The aim of the Meeting translation project is to provide a platform for multi-lingual meetings. In order for the system to work efficiently, a robust backend is required to augment the automatic recognition and translation services. The existing backend was a very simple proof-of-concept that supported a single user only. The goal of this project was to develop a backend that could support the realtime needs of this project. The backend was also required to support multiple users and meetings simultaneously. Another important aspect of the project was to test the robustness and efficiency of the system. Hence, a statistics collection system was also required that could give us enough information about the different processes in the pipeline to analyze and pin-point the deficiencies in the system. Upon completion, a fully working system was built that could support multiple users and meetings. The system integrated well with the translation and transcription services already available. The statistics collection system was also built and the results from the system were used to analyze the bottlenecks in the processing. The system was tested in both the English and the Arabic language.

			“I want my Mommy” is a research project that aims to use wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to quickly locate people in a large crowd, subsequently reducing the number of lost people. In several crowded areas such as Makkah and Disneyland, people getting separated (specially children and elderly) from their families is a huge problem. This is currently handled manually by making announcements or giving people tags with information written on them. Unfortunately, these solutions do not work in highly crowded areas, both because of the number of people entering the location, and because of the size of these places. We plan to devise an algorithm using commonly existing wireless technologies to reduce the number of lost people by categorizing the crowd into groups without any barrier-to-entry.

			Small, autonomous watercraft are an ideal approach to a number of applications in flood mitigation and response, environmental sampling, and numerous other applications. Relative to other types of vehicles, watercraft are inexpensive, simple, robust and reliable.  The vision is to have large numbers of very inexpensive airboats provide situational awareness and deliver critical emergency supplies to victims, as well as low cost tools for environmental protection and monitoring. My role in this project was to create a visual interface to analyze and understand the data collected by the boats.

			Malware Inc. is a project that aims to study the development of Malware on various platforms, such as Web browsers, Social networks and Web engines. I chose Mozilla Firefox as my research platform, as it is the second most widely used web browser today. Having a wide audience adds to the importance of this research project, because the security of a higher number of people is at stake. My role in this research project was to study Firefox extensions, small pieces of code that help in enhancing the browsing experience. These extensions, although very helpful, have the potential to be used for malicious purposes.

		<div class="research-abstract">	
			This work aims to explore the role of Natural Gestures in daily interaction with computer systems, in particular, their use in the navigation of touchscreen interfaces. Gestures provide a way for users to navigate an interface through intuitive on­screen touch motions and are leading to a shift from traditional point and click interactions to a more natural and physical way of interaction. Given the increased popularity of public touchscreen kiosks in various settings such as airports, hospitals and company lobbies, we designed and built a test­bed platform for exploring touchscreen interface design for users of mixed lingual and cultural backgrounds. Inspired by the increasing prominence of gestures in commercial touchscreen devices, our aim was to explore the effects of language and culture on gestures, including the impact of various aspects such as screen size on the usability and practicality of these gestures. We implemented a few of these gestures into our interface, such as natural scrolling, which enables the user to flick their fingers across the screen in order to browse through a list of items. As part of future work, we seek to implement additional gestures into the interface such as screen swiping and to deploy this system on a kiosk at Carnegie Mellon Qatar&#39;s campus for the purpose of collecting logs and running experiments. Through these experiments we seek to learn more about the interaction of users with the interface, their preferences and navigation performance, while considering the roles of language and culture in this region.
