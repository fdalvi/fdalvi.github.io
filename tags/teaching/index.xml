      <description>Hassan Sajjad and I just had a great time delivering a 5-day crash course at the Universität Duisburg-Essen. It was delivered roughly over 18 hours - with quite a lot of practical exercises! Check out the course materials.
Duisburg was a nice and calm place, with a döner restaurant ready to greet you almost around every corner. The Königstraße was super-lively with a lot of pop-up shops and restaurants, and was quite a fun walk in the afternoon.</description>
