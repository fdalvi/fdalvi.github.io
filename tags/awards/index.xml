      <description>One of our projects in the Arabic Language Team at the Qatar Computing Research Institute is the Speech Translation Project - a real-time low-latency system where a speaker&amp;rsquo;s voice is transcribed and translated (both in Arabic or English). Check out the project here.
This project was recently awarded the Best Innovation Award at the annual Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference! It was been a long effort to take our state-of-the-art research in Speech Recognition and Machine Translation and bring it all together in one system.</description>
