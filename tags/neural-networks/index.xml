      <description>Hassan Sajjad and I just had a great time delivering a 5-day crash course at the Universität Duisburg-Essen. It was delivered roughly over 18 hours - with quite a lot of practical exercises! Check out the course materials.
Duisburg was a nice and calm place, with a döner restaurant ready to greet you almost around every corner. The Königstraße was super-lively with a lot of pop-up shops and restaurants, and was quite a fun walk in the afternoon.</description>

      <description>It is quite common to use a One-Hot representation for categorical data in machine learning, for example textual instances in Natural Language Processing tasks. In Keras, the Embedding layer automatically takes inputs with the category indices (such as [5, 3, 1, 5]) and converts them into dense vectors of some length (e.g. 5 → [0.2 1.7 3.2 -7.6 ...]). What actually happens internally is that 5 gets converted to a one-hot vector (like [0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 .</description>
