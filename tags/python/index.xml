      <description>Hassan Sajjad and I just had a great time delivering a 5-day crash course at the Universität Duisburg-Essen. It was delivers roughly over 18 hours - with quite a lot of practical exercises! Check out the course materials.
Duisburg was a nice and calm place, not a lot of crowded places. A döner place was ready to greet you almost around every corner, and the Königstraße was super-lively with a lot of pop-up shops and restaurants.</description>

      <description>It is quite common to use a One-Hot representation for categorical data in machine learning, for example textual instances in Natural Language Processing tasks. In Keras, the Embedding layer automatically takes inputs with the category indices (such as [5, 3, 1, 5]) and converts them into dense vectors of some length (e.g. 5 → [0.2 1.7 3.2 -7.6 ...]). What actually happens internally is that 5 gets converted to a one-hot vector (like [0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 .</description>
