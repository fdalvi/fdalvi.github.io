      <description>2019  Identifying And Controlling Important Neurons In Neural Machine Translation  Anthony Bau, Yonatan Belinkov, Hassan Sajjad, Nadir Durrani, Fahim Dalvi, James Glass   Seventh International Conference on Learning Representations  Neural machine translation (NMT) models learn representations containing substantial linguistic information. However, it is not clear if such information is fully distributed or if some of it can be attributed to individual neurons. We develop unsupervised methods for discovering important neurons in NMT models.</description>

      <description>From Theory to Practice: Deep Learning for NLP Co-Lecturer Universität Duisburg-Essen, 2018 A 5-day lecture series covering the basics of machine learning, neural networks and deep neural networks. We look at several deep neural network architectures from the perspective of applying them to various classification tasks, such as sequence prediction and generation. Every lecture is accompanied with practice problems implemented in Keras, a popular Python framework for deep learning.   Deep Learning for Machine Translation Co-Lecturer DGfS Computational Linguistics Fall School, 2017 A 10-lecture crash course in deep learning, specialized towards machine translation.</description>

      <title>Creating Video Screencaps using FFMPEG and ImageMagick</title>
      <link>https://fdalvi.github.io/blog/2018-09-01-creating-video-screencaps/</link>

      <description>I recently wanted to create screencaps for a large set of videos of various lengths and resolutions - basically screenshot each video 5 times, and then combine these 5 screencaps all into one nice image per video, with all of the images being of consistent size.
&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://github.com/fdalvi/video-screencaps/blob/master/docs/sample%20-%20500px.jpg?raw=true&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Sample render from a seaplane ride over Vancouver&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sample render from a seaplane ride over Vancouver&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;  
 There are a bunch of tools available online that I can either install locally, or upload my video files to get similar results - but given that this was easily achievable using simple tools like ffmpeg and imagemagick, I decided to whip up a quick script to accomplish this.</description>

      <title>Introducing GroupMe Archiver</title>

      <description>I was recently looking into various ways of archiving old chats into something more future proof, but it seems like these tools are very limited. They either don&amp;rsquo;t exist, or only work for specific scenarios like one-on-one chats without attachments.
Today, the situation gets a bit better for one platform, GroupMe. GroupMe is a platform focused on group messaging, and features nice subtle features like likes per message, attachments and so on.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for NLP Crash Course @ Uni Duisburg-Essen</title>

      <description>Hassan Sajjad and I just had a great time delivering a 5-day crash course at the Universität Duisburg-Essen. It was delivered roughly over 18 hours - with quite a lot of practical exercises! Check out the course materials.
Duisburg was a nice and calm place, with a döner restaurant ready to greet you almost around every corner. The Königstraße was super-lively with a lot of pop-up shops and restaurants, and was quite a fun walk in the afternoon.</description>

      <title>One-Hot layer in Keras&#39;s Sequential API</title>

      <description>It is quite common to use a One-Hot representation for categorical data in machine learning, for example textual instances in Natural Language Processing tasks. In Keras, the Embedding layer automatically takes inputs with the category indices (such as [5, 3, 1, 5]) and converts them into dense vectors of some length (e.g. 5 → [0.2 1.7 3.2 -7.6 ...]). What actually happens internally is that 5 gets converted to a one-hot vector (like [0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 .</description>

      <description>One of our projects in the Arabic Language Team at the Qatar Computing Research Institute is the Speech Translation Project - a real-time low-latency system where a speaker&amp;rsquo;s voice is transcribed and translated (both in Arabic or English). Check out the project here.
This project was recently awarded the Best Innovation Award at the annual Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference! It was been a long effort to take our state-of-the-art research in Speech Recognition and Machine Translation and bring it all together in one system.</description>

      <title>Network throttling in Puppeteer</title>

      <description>Puppeteer is an awesome way to run Chrome (or Chromium) in headless mode, i.e. load and interact with web pages without ever visually seeing them.
 Why would this be useful?
A headless browser is a great way to automate testing, even on remote server machines!
 Puppeteer provides a nice interface through Node to script any interactions you can have with a page, like entering input in a textbox, clicking a button and so on.</description>

      <description>As a Teaching Assistant for the course, part of my responsibilities was to prepare and deliver recitations every Thursday. These recitations reviewed the material from the week&amp;rsquo;s lectures, talked about assignments and just generally served as a platform to clear any lingering confusion or doubts. All these slides were created from scratch, but a lot of inspiration was drawn from previous recitations for the same course.
 Week 1: Introduction [slides] Week 2: Floating point representations [slides] Week 3: Introduction to Assembly [slides] [code] Week 4: Assembly continued [slides] [code] Week 5: C Data-structures [slides] [code] Week 6: System Memory management [slides] Week 7: Exam 1 preparation [slides] Week 8: C Signals and UNIX IO [slides] [code] Week 9: Virtual Memory [slides] [code] Week 10: Memory Allocation in C and Debugging tips [slides] Week 11: Exam 2 preparation [slides] Week 12: Proxies [slides] Week 13: Proxies continued and concurrency [slides] [code] Week 14: Final exam review [slides]  Feel free to use the above material for your own courses.</description>

      <description>Hassan Sajjad and I were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to teach a deep learning course at the Computation Linguistics school organized by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sprachwissenschaft. This course is geared towards students with a limited background in deep and machine learning. It walks them through building their very first machine learning model, all the way up to developing a strong intuition behind sequence-to-sequence models, with the material wrapped in the context of language.</description>

      <description>Hassan Sajjad and I got another chance to teach our deep learning course, but this time it was only for five days, delivered over roughly 18 hours! This course is a bit more general than our DGfS course, and has a lot more practical material.
The official spiel  In this lecture series, we cover the basics of machine learning, neural networks and deep neural networks. We look at several deep neural network architectures from the perspective of applying them to various classification tasks, such as sequence prediction and generation.</description>
